# Welcome to Relish

## Tradefull’s Design System

Welcome to Relish, Tradefull’s living design system. Its purpose is to form an underlying language that unites our visual style, components, and interaction patterns across design and code. The system provides a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of digital products. It is maintained by the UX/UI team and regularly evolves to meet Tradefull’s changing needs.

Our goal is to improve UI consistency and quality, helping make our software design and development processes more efficient. We also hope to establish a common vocabulary between everyone in our organization and ease collaboration between different teams.

<br />

## Design Principles

These principles form the foundation of our design system. They guide our team when working on different parts of the system and help us do better and more informed decisions.

<br />

##### PLACE USER NEEDS FIRST

We care for the people who use our products. We are here to make their day-to-day and long-term work better and more pleasant through great user experience.

<br />

##### CONSISTENCY, NOT UNIFORMITY

We should use the same language and design patterns wherever possible. This helps people get familiar with our services.

<br />

##### DEFAULT TO OPENNESS

We should share what we are doing whenever we can. Building our services transparently increases their visibility and accountability and makes us push towards higher quality.

<br />

##### ACCESSIBLE

Our services are for everyone. We make sure people with different needs can use our products and that they meet the accessibility standards outlined in WCAG 2.1.

<br />

##### AUTOMATE

We value the time of our colleagues, users, and our future selves over our own. We are always proactively looking for ways to automate repetitive tasks and testing.

<br />

##### GOOD EXPERIENCE

Last but certainly not least, we aim to provide developers with an enjoyable experience. Developers should be able to start using our tools in minutes, not hours, days or weeks.

<br />

## Design System Benefits

##### EFFICIENCY

Designers no longer need to repeatedly rebuild components from scratch. A shared library of components streamlines this process and leaves less room for error.

<br />

##### CONSISTENCY

Having a shared set of principles and rules to build components makes it easier to create consistent user experiences that accurately represent Tradefull across a variety of platforms.

<br />

##### SCALE

Increased efficiency and consistency facilitate building products that scale
