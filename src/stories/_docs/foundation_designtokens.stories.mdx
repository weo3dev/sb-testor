# Design Tokens

Design tokens are an abstraction of design decisions made to construct and maintain an application design system.

Spacing, color, typography, styles and animation are represented as data. They are used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all our product experiences and platforms.

Design tokens are directly integrated into our component library.

### Global Tokens

Global tokens are the primitive values in our design language, represented by context-agnostic names. Color palette, spacing, typography, and dimension values are all recorded as global tokens. These can be directly used, and are inherited by all other token types.

### Alias Tokens or Common Tokens

Alias tokens relate to a specific context or abstraction. Aliases help communicate the intended purpose of a token, and are effective when a value with a single intent will appear in multiple places.

<br />

### Component Specific Tokens

Component-specific tokens have the most specific component level context. They often inherit from alias or global tokens, but are named in a way that allows consumers to be as specific as possible in applying tokens in component development.
